# BuildingIdentity
The aim of this project is to investigate ancient identities as expressed through architecture, in Ancient Nubia. Ancient Nubia, a border region now shared by Egypt and Sudan, preesents distinct architectural structures and this study focuses on the diachronic relationship between Nubian communities and the built environment.
